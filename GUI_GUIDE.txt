PPTX to PDF Converter - GUI Quick Guide
============================================================

LAUNCHING THE GUI:
------------------
Double-click: "Start Converter.bat"
OR run: python converter_gui.py


THE THREE OPTIONS:
------------------

1. 📄 CONVERT SINGLE FILE
   ├─ Click the button
   ├─ Browse and select one PPTX file
   └─ Conversion starts automatically

   Use when: You have one presentation to convert


2. 📑 CONVERT MULTIPLE FILES
   ├─ Click the button
   ├─ Select multiple PPTX files (Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click)
   └─ All selected files will be converted

   Use when: You have specific files scattered in different folders


3. 📁 CONVERT ENTIRE FOLDER
   ├─ Click the button
   ├─ Select a folder containing PPTX files
   └─ ALL PPTX files in that folder (and subfolders) will be converted

   Use when: You have a folder with many presentations


OUTPUT SETTINGS:
----------------

PDF QUALITY:
Choose quality level that balances file size and image quality:

• SCREEN/WEB (like PowerPoint) - 96 DPI
  ├─ Smallest files (460MB → ~5-10MB)
  ├─ Best for emailing and web sharing
  └─ Good for screen viewing

• STANDARD (Balanced) - 150 DPI ⭐ DEFAULT
  ├─ Medium files (460MB → ~30-40MB)
  ├─ Good balance of quality and size
  └─ Suitable for most uses

• HIGH QUALITY (Print) - 300 DPI
  ├─ Larger files (460MB → ~90-100MB)
  ├─ Professional printing quality
  └─ Sharp when zoomed

• MAXIMUM QUALITY (Archive) - 600 DPI
  ├─ Largest files (460MB → ~150MB+)
  ├─ Archival/master copy quality
  └─ Maximum detail preservation

OUTPUT DIRECTORY:
By default, PDFs are saved in the same location as the original PPTX files.

To change output location:
1. Click "Browse..." in the Output Settings section
2. Select where you want PDFs to be saved
3. Click "Reset" to go back to default behavior


WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
----------------
▪ Progress Bar - Shows overall conversion progress
▪ Status Log - Real-time updates on what's happening
  ✓ Green text = Success
  ✗ Red text = Failed/Error
▪ LibreOffice Status - Bottom left corner shows if LibreOffice is ready


TIPS:
-----
• Large files (450MB+) may take several minutes to convert
• You can't start a new conversion while one is running
• The "Clear Log" button clears the status messages
• Failed conversions don't stop the batch process


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Problem: "LibreOffice Not Found" (red text at bottom)
Solution: Install LibreOffice from https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/

Problem: GUI doesn't open
Solution: Make sure Python is installed. Run: python --version

Problem: Conversion fails
Solution: Check if the PPTX file opens in LibreOffice Impress


EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
-----------------
1. Double-click "Start Converter.bat"
2. GUI opens
3. Check bottom left - should show "✓ LibreOffice Ready"
4. Click "📁 Convert Entire Folder"
5. Select your presentations folder
6. Watch the progress bar and log
7. Done! PDFs are in the same folder as your PPTX files


CONVERTING 450MB FILES:
-----------------------
✓ No problem! The converter is designed for large files
✓ Just be patient - may take 5-10 minutes per file
✓ Watch the status log for progress updates
✓ Don't close the window while converting
